# Exercise 3

In this exercise, you will practice working with event-driven programming to create an interactive drawing application! The idea is that you can draw lines on your canvas by clicking on the canvas, holding your mouse down, and then dragging your mouse to a new location. Your final web-page will look like this:

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`js/index.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments. Note that you should ___not___ edit the HTML file!

You can see the results of your work by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser. Remember to refresh the page after you update your code, and to check for any errors in the Developer console.

## Testing
This exercise includes a test suite to verify **ONLY** the syntax of your code. It will **NOT** check the functionality of your work. We will be checking the drawing you save in the `img/` folder to give you credit!

You can run the test suite using

```bash
# Run from parent directory
jest exercise-3
```
