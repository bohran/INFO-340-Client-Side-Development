# Exercise 2

In this exercise, you will practice with JavaScript functions, control structures, objects, and basic searching (a la [here](https://github.com/infx598i-s17/module11-searching)). This problem will also exercise your algorithmic design skills!

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`js/index.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments.

You can see the results of your work either by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser and viewing the output in the [Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/), or by running the script directly using Node.js:

```bash
# from the exercise-2 directory
node js/index.js
```


## Testing
This exercise includes a test suite to verify that the outputted content is correct. Note that this test is simply to help you verify your results; it will not ensure that your code follows the required syntactical approach.

You can run the test suite using

```bash
jest exercise-2
```

Note that extraneous or missing logged output will cause the tests to fail.
